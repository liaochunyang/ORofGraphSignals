# On the Optimal Recovery of Graph Signals

This repository contains the numerical experiments accompanying the paper 

- On the Optimal Recovery of Graph Signals. Simon Foucart, Chunyang Liao, and Nate Veldt.

Reproducing the experiments requires additional software to be installed: in MATLAB, CVX (http://cvxr.com/cvx/) is necessary.
