# On the Optimal Recovery of Graph Signals

This repository contains the numerical experiments accompanying the paper 
"On the Optimal Recovery of Graph Signals" written by Simon Foucart, Chunyang Liao, and Nate Veldt.

Reproducing the experiments requires additional software to be installed: in MATLAB, CVX (http://cvxr.com/cvx/) is necessary.
